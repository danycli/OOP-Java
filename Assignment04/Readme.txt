It is a dashboard of an RPG Game with clickable buttons,clean UI 
and at the begining there is a login page where you have to enter 
proper name and pass, you will be unable to login if you don't 
know the credentials, or if you forgot the credentials you can 
simply click on forgot password to reset the password along with 
the username.
And the widows are non-resizeable, I do this intentionally 
because without that I have to make it responsive and the 
time was too short for that and honestly I don't know how to 
make a responsive frame.

The screenshots of every window poping up is in the screenshots
folder.

**Notice!!**
(Our project is basically of Cricket Score Board but the time I 
get to know that we have to make the assignmnet based on our project 
it was almost ready, as I was just following your instructuctions 
which you explain in the last lecture regarding the dashboard.)
